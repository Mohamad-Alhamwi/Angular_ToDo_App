# To-Do Application

This is a simple to-do application to practice what I have learned while studying Angular, Nodejs and MongoDB.

## Features

- User can register to the application.
- User can log into the application.
- User can see an `input` field where he can click on to create a new to-do list.
- By pressing a button, the user can submit the to-do list and can see that being added to a list of to-do lists.
- User can edit a to-do list.
- User can delete a to-do list.
- User can archive a to-do list.
- User can see the date when he created and edited the to-do list.
- User can mark a to-do item as `completed` by pressing on the item itself.
- User can remove a to-do item by pressing on a button.
- The to-do lists will be stored in database. So the user can see the lists later when logs in again to the application.
- A list can have three status; a `new` status if it contains no completed item, an `in progress` status if it holds at least one completed item, a `completed` status if all the list items are done.
- User can sort the lists by creation or last modified date.
- User can sort the lists by a list state.
